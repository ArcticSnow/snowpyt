=================================== 

Snowpyt is a Python package to read, vizualize and import snowpit data. Best practice is to import snowpit data in the [CAAML V6 format](http://caaml.org/). An easy way to generate `CAAML` is use [niviz](https://niviz.org/). 

Snowpyt allows flexible ploting of snowpyt, including official snow crystal symbols.
