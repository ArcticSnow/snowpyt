        Feel free to contribute to the project!!!! Many new features can be added...
        
        ## To do:
        
        ### High Priority
        
        - Include option to add chemical sample name to pit
        - Check if the list of symbols is complete in reference to Fierz et al. 2009
        - reorganize package example, standard excel and csv snowpit file
        - format package as an actual Python package, and make it available on Pipy
        - make ground appear to comfirm the user thayt the pit reached ground. add note about ground type.
        
        ### Low priority 
        - add option to load pit directly from excel file .xslx
        - improve the final layout (e.g. overlapping snowflake symbol)
        - specify the figure size and adjust font size in respect
        - render the medatadata text better
        - create new plot combination (include grain diameter plot)
        - put option to adjust figure size to desired size and dpi
        - add option to save pits in Pickle format or CSV
        - add option to save figure in matplotlib format
        
        
        
        ## Objective
        The objective of this library is to provide visualization tool for snowpit data. 
        Started for the need of the Svalbard Snow Research group, this package should evolve
         to include more snowpit type and visualization scheme. 
         
        The snow grain classification follows the guidelines provided by the UNESCO 
        [International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground](http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001864/186462e.pdf) 
        (Fierz et al., 2009)
        
        Fierz, C., Amstrong, R.L., Durand, Y., Etchevers, P., Greene, E., McClung, D.M., Nishimura, K., Satyawali, P.K. and Sokratov, S.A. 2009.The International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground. IHP-VII Technical Documents in 
        Hydrology N°83, IACS Contribution N°1, UNESCO-IHP, Paris. 
        
        ## Installation
        Clone the github repository to a local directory using the following command in your terminal
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/ArcticSnow/snowpyt.git
        ```
        or by downloading the package
        
        The package contains all the functions to plot the snowpit if library requirements are met. It also contains data samples to test the library.
        
        ### requirements
        
        Python 2.7.9 with the following libraries:
        - [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
        - [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
        - [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
        
        ## Use
        
        1. Snowpit must be formated following the template file "Standard_pit.xlsx"
        2. Export the snowpit to a csv file using tab as delimiter
        3. Individual snowpits have to be loaded into python class object from which the user can easily access information. See the file Example.py for an example of a basic use.
        
        ## Want to contribute?
        Once you have cloned the project to your home directory, create a git branch and here you go. When your edits are stable, merge with the master branch. See this neat tutorial about git branching and merging, [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)
