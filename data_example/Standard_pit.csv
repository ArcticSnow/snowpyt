Snowpit form for Snowpyt package														
														
Method:	1. Input values in green. If no value, leave cell empty													
	2. make sure spelling of snowflakes is correct, and hardness code is computed													
	3. save as csv file with tab delimiting fields													
	4. ready to import with Snowpyt package!
